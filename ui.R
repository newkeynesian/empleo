During the 1980s and 1990s, women's participation in the labor market increased, largely due to the impacts that the restructuring processes and economic crisis had on households. In that period, the insertion of women into the labor market acted as a compensatory mechanism for households: to face income loss by other members of the household, women had to insert themselves into market activities to preserve the purchasing power of the household. However, this expansion was later followed by a period of stagnation in the percentage of women participating in the Mexican labor market .
The low female participation in the labor market, as well as the experience of women within the labor field, is the result of the social norms that regulate the autonomy of women. These traditional social norms establish a relationship of subordination between men and women, where women are subordinate to men . This relationship of subordination has persisted over time and prevails in some current work situations for women."),

The persistence of these norms is mainly because they are transmitted from generation to generation by those men and women who preserve these types of ideologies. These norms shape the experience of women in the labor market . The explicit expression of these norms is harassment and discrimination in the workplace, such as the wage gap that characterizes the Mexican labor market.
In the Mexican case, since the end of the 20th century, the wage gap between men and women, conditioning by characteristics such as education, age, among other variables, has been reduced to a gap of 9% in the first decade of the 21st century; however, this closing of the labor gap is mainly due to the fact that women who participate in the Mexican labor market are inserted in better paid jobs than the vast majority of those in which men are inserted ."),
